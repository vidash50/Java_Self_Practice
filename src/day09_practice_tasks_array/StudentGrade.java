/*
4. Create a class named StudentGrade and write a program with the following specifications:
	4.1 Given two arrays with the same length:
		   studentNames (String[])
		   scores (int[])

   	4.2 Write a program to determine and store the students' grades in an array of characters named grades.

   2.3 Print the grade report for each student in separate lines.

			Example:
				String[] names = {"Anna", "Nancy", "Sarah"};
				int[] scores = {90, 75, 80};

			Output:
				grades = {'A', 'C', 'B'};
				Anna's score is 90, and grade is A
				Nancy's score is 75, and grade is C
				Sarah's score is 80, and grade is B
